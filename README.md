# Pandemic-Flu
Final project for P2P &amp; Blockchains
This project aims to implement and study a model describing the diffusion of a virus between smartphones which communicate through Bluetooth connections. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between mobile devices over short distances and has security policies suitable for this experiment. In fact, it provides a coupling mechanism, called *JUST WORKS*, which allows devices to connect without high security controls. 
To build this model has been implemented a JAVA application to simulate devices' movements and interactions.

The simulation takes place in a wide area in which different kind of devices moves free, this area is characterized by zones of interests, called *hotspot*, in which the devices aggregate. 
These hotspots are used to represent places with high density in the real-world that could be, for instance, supermarkets, bars, restaurants, malls, etc. 
The devices can move between these places and when they are in can stop or explore them.
